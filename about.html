			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>The championship is played in F1 22, one of the most 
				realistic and immersive racing games available. 
				The virtual tracks are faithfully recreated, and the 
				cars are modelled to behave just like their real-world 
				counterparts. This means that the races are incredibly 
				competitive and require skill, strategy, and nerves of 
				steel to win.</p>
			<p>The races in the Gulag Formula 1 Championship 2023 
				are designed to be exciting and challenging, and 
				follow a specific format. Firstly, the championship uses a 15-minute qualifying round to determine the starting grid for the race. During this time, drivers take to the track and try to set the fastest lap time possible. The drivers
				 who post the fastest times will start at the front 
				 of the grid, giving them a significant advantage over 
				 their competitors.</p>
			<p>Once the qualifying round is over, the drivers
				 then take to the track for the race itself. The
				  races in the Gulag Formula 1 Championship are set
				   to 25% of the complete race distance, which means
				    that they're shorter than a full race but still
					 long enough to be challenging.</p>
			<p>
				During the race, drivers have to navigate the track,
				 manage their tires and fuel, and try to overtake their 
				 opponents. The championship features realistic damage 
				 and penalties, so drivers need to be careful not to 
				 damage their cars or break the rules, or they risk 
				 being penalized and losing valuable time.
			</p>
			<p>The Gulag Formula 1 Championship is not just about 
				winning, though. It's also about the community. 
				Drivers come together every Sunday to compete, chat, 
				and have fun. The championship is open to everyone, 
				regardless of skill level, and drivers are encouraged 
				to help each other improve.</p>
